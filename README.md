# Application's Purpose
This repo will contain the xcodeproj file as well as the resource files and swift files associated. The program is essentially a list of characters from the game *Deltarune* and when the character cell is tapped, it will take the user into a detailed view of that character and description. There is a surprise button in each detailed view that changes the text of the screen.  

# Known Errors
No known errors

# References
I used the SwiftUi Essentials textbook to look up syntax and documentation. I also consulted the Landmarks Tutorial from Apple and the Car tutorial we did in class. I also looked at [stack overflow for the button changing text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57798506/change-button-background-colour-on-tap-in-swiftui)

# Instructions
## To run the files:
1. Run the program in Xcode simulator using the IPhone 11 simulator.
